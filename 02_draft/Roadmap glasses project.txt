Roadmap glasses project - 13/05/2020

1. Write to Neil Handley, ask about current situation, possibility of accessing archives for local RAs, and possibility to ask for them to digitize them against payment. Ask how many pages are in each catalogue to get a sense of the amount of work. Insist on whether they are interested in collaborating for the digitalization of this material.
2. Look online for historical data for UK about the number and ideally demographics of book and/newspaper readers by district.
3. Look for data on distribution of books sold by district
4. Look for data on number and demographics of subscribers to encyclopaediae (along the lines of Squicciarini-Voigtlander, JPE paper on France)
