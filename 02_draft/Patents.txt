Description:

I think that for 1617-1852 they have 14,359 patents

The details recorded in the Rolls usually included the name, rank and address of the patentee, 
the title of the invention, a formal recitation of the terms of the monopoly (patent) granted and 
the date of grant. From the 1730s onwards patentees were also obliged to file a specification which described their invention in technical detail.

Hi Gregori,

Thank you for your follow up enquiry.

You will need to come into the Reading Room to conduct this research when re open. Therefore please monitor our website regarding this at: www.bl.uk

Unfortunately, I cannot confirm the number of Patents between 1600 to 1850, again you will need to carry out research onsite.

I am now thinking that the patent resource that you are referring to could be the Blackwells Idealist database, which is an in house patent tool. Please note that this is normally operated by Staff on the Enquiry Desk. However, in the light of the Coronavirus and the safe distancing, that moving forward we will all have to observe. I am sure that you can understand that there maybe some difficulties with this? You will need to be guided by advice nearer the time.

It may be that once we have re opened, you may also wish to research some of the other manual patent materials in the Reading Room, which cover things such as the British Chronological Patent Index etc.

I hope that this information is helpful.

Kind regards,

Sonya.

Dear Gregori,

Thank you for your enquiry.

The Electronic Resource that you are referring to is the British Granted Patent Specifications datastore. The resource covers the years 1617 to 1899. Please note that this is not a searchable database, you are required to know the patent numbers and their corresponding years.

Please also note that we regret that we are unable to provide you with remote access. Normally, holders of current Reader passes have access from our Reading Room onsite. Of course at the present time the British Library is currently closed due to the Coronavirus.

However, if you can provide the details for up to five patents we may be able to send you a maximum of five PDF patent copies.

I hope that you will find this response helpful.

Kind regards,

Sonya.
